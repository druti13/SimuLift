# Elevator Simulation

## Project Overview

This project is an Elevator Simulation that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask to create a web-based interactive simulation of an elevator system. The simulation aims to demonstrate how an elevator operates in a building with multiple floors, handling requests from users to move between floors.

## Features

   - Interactive User Interface: Users can click buttons to request the elevator from any floor to any other floor.
   - Real-time Elevator Movement: The elevator moves between floors in real-time, displaying its current position.
   - Multiple Elevators: The simulation can operate with multiple elevators.
   - Intelligent Elevator Selection: The simulation includes an algorithm that selects the nearest elevator to the call location.
   - LOOK Algorithm: The elevator movement algorithm is based on the LOOK algorithm, which optimizes the order of floor stops.

## Technologies Used

   - HTML: For structuring the web pages.
   - CSS: For styling the user interface.
   - JavaScript: For handling the interactive elements and real-time updates.
   - Flask: For the backend server and handling the simulation logic.
